        I am really fond of animals but my favorite among all animals are dogs. The four footed, bright shiny eyes and powerful sense of smelling is what makes them different from other animals. They are robust and are extremely loving and faithful to their masters. There are many kinds of dogs, such as Grey Hounds, Bull Dogs, Lap Dogs, Blood Hounds Etc.
        they have sharp teeth and their sense of hearing is also exemplary.

        I had a pet dog and its name was Rancho.
        It was a dachshund and had a black coat. He was very smart,
        agile and active. He  had long ears and a long tail. All dogs are
        extremely faithful and loving. They are most affectionate of all the animals. I have always wanted to adopt a dog but I was delighted beyond words when my friend gifted me a cute little puppy. He was just 30 days old and was so fragile and soft. It wagged its tail just as I saw it and I knew it was mine.
